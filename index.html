        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Greetings to everyone! I'm Tykk, a 14-year-old aspiring web designer on the brink of turning 15. Designing websites isn't just a hobby; it's my dream to bring happiness to everyone through my creations. Allow me to share a glimpse of my journeyâ€”a website I crafted at the tender age of 8. It may have a few bugs, hastily assembled, so please approach it with understanding rather than judgment. The learning process is ongoing, and I'm excited about every step. Feel free to connect with me via the contact details in the navigation bar. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and feedback. Here's to the journey of crafting digital wonders that began in childhood!
</p>

<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>Please be aware that the websites I have created may contain some bugs or issues. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your understanding and patience as I work to resolve these issues. If you encounter any problems, please feel free to bring them to my attention, and I will do my best to address them promptly. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
